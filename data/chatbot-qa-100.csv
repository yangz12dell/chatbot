Question,Answer
What's PowerScale?,PowerScale hybrid storage platforms powered by the OneFS operating system use a versatile yet simple scale-out architecture to speed access to massive amounts of data. The highly flexible hybrid platforms strike the balance between large capacity and high-performance storage to provide support for a broad range of enterprise file workloads.
What's OneFS Group Management Protocol?,"Cluster coherence and quorum is handled by OneFS Group Management Protocol (GMP). The GMP is built on several distributed algorithms and strictly adheres to Brewer’s Theorem, which states that it is impossible for a distributed computer system to simultaneously guarantee all three of the following; consistency, availability and partition tolerance. The group management protocol keeps track of the state of all the nodes and drives that are considered part of the cluster. Whenever devices are added or removed from the cluster, a group change is broadcast, the group ID is incremented, and any uncommitted journal write transactions are resolved. "
How to decide the file layout of OneFS?,The way data is laid out across the nodes and their respective disks in a cluster is fundamental to OneFS functionality. The layout decisions are made by the BAM on the node that initiated a particular write operation using 2PC. The BAM Safe Write (BSW) code takes the cluster group information from GMP and the desired protection policy for the file and makes an informed decision on where best to write the data blocks to ensure the file is properly protected. 
What's the usage of Automatic Provisioning?,"With Automatic Provisioning, every set of equivalent node hardware is automatically divided into node pools comprising up to forty nodes and six drives per node. These node pools are protected by default at +2d:1n, and multiple pools can then be combined into logical tiers and managed using SmartPools file pool policies."
What's Node Pools?,"Node Pools are groups of Disk Pools, spread across similar storage nodes (compatibility classes). Multiple groups of different node types can work together in a single, heterogeneous cluster. "
What is Data Integrity?,"Data Integrity (IDI) is the OneFS process that protects file system structures against corruption via 32-bit CRC checksums. All OneFS file system blocks utilize checksum verification. Metadata checksums are housed in the metadata blocks themselves, whereas file data checksums are stored as metadata, thereby providing referential integrity. All checksums are recomputed by the initiator, the node servicing a particular read, on every request."
What is MediaScan?,"MediaScan’s role within OneFS is to check disk sectors and deploy the above DSR mechanism in order to force disk drives to fix any sector ECC errors they may encounter. Implemented as one of the phases of the OneFS job engine, MediaScan is run automatically based on a predefined schedule."
What is IntegrityScan?,"IntegrityScan, another component of the OneFS job engine, is responsible for examining the entire file system for inconsistencies. It does this by systematically reading every block and verifying its associated checksum. "
How does Rolling upgrade work?,"A rolling upgrade individually upgrades and restarts each node in the cluster sequentially. During a rolling upgrade, the cluster remains online and continues serving data to clients with no interruption in service."
How do Non-disruptive Upgrades work?,"Non-disruptive upgrades (NDUs) allow a cluster administrator to upgrade the storage OS while their end users continue to access data without error or interruption. Updating the operating system on a cluster is a simple matter of a rolling upgrade. During this process, one node at a time is upgraded to the new code, and the active NFS and SMB3 clients attached to it are automatically migrated to other nodes in the cluster."
What is Recovery Time Objective?,"Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is the allotted amount of time within a Service Level Agreement (SLA) to recover data. For example, an RTO of four hours means data must be restored and made available within four hours of an outage."
What is Recovery Point Objective?,"Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is the acceptable amount of data loss that can be tolerated per an SLA. With an RPO of 30-minutes, this is the maximum amount of time that can elapse since the last backup or snapshot was taken."
How is Snapshot scheduled?,"Snapshot schedules are configured at a daily, weekly, monthly or yearly interval, with single or multiple job frequency per schedule, down to a per-minute granularity. And automatic deletion can be configured per defined schedule at an hourly through yearly range."
What's the process of snapshot deleting?,"When snapshots are manually deleted, OneFS will mark the appropriate snapshot IDs and queue a job engine job to affect their removal. The SnapshotDelete job is queued immediately but the job engine will typically wait a minute or so to actually start running it. During this interval, the snapshot will be marked as ‘delete pending’."
How to restore a snapshot?,"For snapshot restoration, SnapshotIQ provides SnapRevert functionality. Using the Job Engine for scheduling, a SnapRevert job automates the restoration of an entire snapshot to its top-level directory.  Additionally, individual files, rather than entire snapshots, can also be restored in place using FileRevert functionality."
What is SyncIQ?,"OneFS SyncIQ software delivers high-performance, asynchronous replication of unstructured data to address a broad range of recovery point objectives (RPO) and recovery time objectives (RTO). "
What's the function of SyncIQ failover and failback?,"In the event that a primary cluster becomes unavailable, SyncIQ provides the ability to failover to a mirrored, DR cluster. During such a scenario, the administrator makes the decision to redirect client I/O to the mirror and initiates SyncIQ failover on the DR cluster. Users will continue to read and write to the DR cluster while the primary cluster is repaired."
What's continuous replication mode in SyncIQ?,"When the “Whenever the source is modified” policy configuration option is selected, SyncIQ will continuously monitor the replication data set (sync domain) and automatically replicate and changes to the target cluster."
What is SmartPools?,"SmartPools software enables the separation of data according to its business value, aligning it with the appropriate class of storage and levels of performance and protection. SmartPools facilitates the creation and management of a dedicated local archive pool within a cluster for data retention and high availability purposes."
What is SmartLock?,"OneFS utilizes SmartLock software to provide immutable storage for data. Based on a write once, read many (WORM) locking capability, SmartLock ensures tamper-proof archiving of critical data sets for disaster recovery and regulatory compliance purposes. Additionally, SmartLock satisfies the regulatory compliance demands of stringent data retention policies, including SEC 17a-4."
What is OneFS hardening?,OneFS provides a hardened profile that can be enabled for sites that are looking for additional security or need to comply with the US Department of Defense’s Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG). This profile can be enabled or disabled on a cluster as required but does require a zero-cost license to activate.

It uses BSD as its base OS because it is a mature and proven Operating System and the open source community can be leveraged for innovation.
What is a cluster?,"OneFS works exclusively with dedicated platformnodes, referred to as a “cluster.” A single cluster consists of multiple nodes, which are rack-mountable enterprise appliances containing: memory, CPU, networking, Ethernet or low-latency InfiniBandinterconnects, disk controllers and storage media. As such, each node in the distributed cluster has compute as well as storage or capacity capabilities. "
What makes up a cluster?,"A single cluster consists of multiple nodes, which are rack-mountable enterprise appliances containing: memory, CPU, networking, Ethernet or low-latency InfiniBandinterconnects, disk controllers and storage media."
What's the minimum requirement to form a cluster?,Individual node platforms need a minimum of three nodes and 3RU of rack space to form a cluster. 
What's the limitation of the storage capacity of a single cluster?,A cluster’s storage capacity can range from tens of TBs to tens of PBs. The maximum capacity will continue to increase as storage media and node chassis continue to get denser.
How is OneFS back-end network designed?,"All intra-node communication in a cluster is performed across a dedicated backend network, comprising either 10, 40, or 100 Gb Ethernet, or low-latency QDR InfiniBand (IB). This back-end network acts as the backplane for the cluster and enables each node to act as a contributor in the cluster and isolating node-to-node communication to a private, high-speed, low-latency network."
How is OneFS front-end network designed?,"Clients connect to the cluster using Ethernet connections that are available on all nodes. A cluster supports standard network communication protocols to a customer network, , including NFS, SMB, HTTP, FTP, HDFS, and S3. Additionally, OneFS provides full integration with both IPv4 and IPv6 environments."
What's SmartConnect?,OneFS SmartConnect is a load balancer that works at the front-end Ethernet layer to evenly distribute client connections across the cluster.
What's client services in OneFS?,"The front-end protocols that the clients can use to interact with OneFS are referred to as client services. Supported protocols include NFS, SMB/CIFS, FTP, HTTP, HDFS, REST API and S3."
How is OneFS caching designed?,The OneFS caching infrastructure design is predicated on aggregating the cache present on each node in a cluster into one globally accessible pool of memory. OneFS uses an efficient messaging system to allow all the nodes’ memory cache to be available to each and every node in the cluster. Remote memory is accessed over an internal interconnect and has much lower latency than accessing hard disk drives.
What is a shadow store?,"OneFS shadow stores are file system containers that allow data to be stored in a sharable manner. Shadow stores are similar to regular files, but typically don’t contain all the metadata typically associated with regular file inodes. In particular, time-based attributes (creation time, modification time, etc.) are explicitly not maintained."
What's LDAP?,"The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a networking protocol used for defining, querying, and modifying services and resources."
What's NIS?,"The Network Information Service (NIS), designed by Sun Microsystems, is a directory services protocol that can be used by OneFS to authenticate users and groups when accessing the cluster."
What's local user in OneFS?,"OneFS supports local user and group authentication. Local authentication can be useful when directory services—Active Directory, LDAP, or NIS—are not used, or when a specific user or application needs to access the cluster."
What's OneFS auditing?,"OneFS provides the ability to audit system configuration and NFS, SMB, and HDFS protocol activity on a cluster. All audit data is stored and protected within the cluster file system and is organized by audit topic. "
What's Simultaneous upgrade?,"A simultaneous upgrade installs the new operating system and reboots all nodes in the cluster at the same time. A simultaneous upgrade requires a temporary, sub-two-minute, interruption of service during the upgrade process while the nodes are restarted."
Why it's advised to run the pre-installation upgrade check?,"As part of an upgrade, OneFS automatically runs a pre-install verification check. This verifies that the configuration in your current installation of OneFS is compatible with the version of OneFS that is intended for the upgrade. Proactively running the pre-installation upgrade check before starting an upgrade helps to avoid any interruption due to incompatible configuration."
What is file system maintenance job?,"File system maintenance jobs perform background file system maintenance, and typically require access to all nodes. These jobs are required to run in default configurations, and often in degraded cluster conditions. Examples include file system protection and drive rebuilds."
What is feature support job?,"The feature support jobs perform work that facilitates some extended storage management function, and typically only run when the feature has been configured. Examples include deduplication and anti-virus scanning."
What is user action job?,User action jobs are run directly by the storage administrator to accomplish some data management goal. Examples include parallel tree deletes and permissions maintenance.
What kind of cloud service does PowerScale support?,Cloud storage solutions for unstructured data include native cloud services and services directly connected to the cloud.

What's the maximum length of file name does OneFS support?,"OneFS long filenames feature provides support for names consisting of up to 255 Unicode characters, by increasing the maximum file name length from 255 bytes to 1024 bytes."
What's the maximum path length does OneFS support?,The OneFS maximum path length is increased from 1024 bytes to 4096 bytes since the release of the long filenames feature.
What's SmartQuotas?,"Dell EMC PowerScale SmartQuotas is a native data management capability which enables enterprises to reduce storage costs with a simple to use, highly scalable, and flexible storage quota and provisioning application for scale-out storage environments."
What is a SmartQuotas domain?,A quota domain defines the files and directories that belong to a quota. 
What's a Quota Tree?,"Each Quota Domain includes a set of usage levels, limits, and configuration options. Most of this information is organized and managed by the file system and stored in the Quota Database. This database is represented in a B-tree structure, known as the Quota Tree, and provides both scalability and fast random access. "
What does a Quota Domain consist of?,"A Quota Domain is made up of the following principle parts: Quota domain key, Quota domain header (QDH), Quota domain enforcements and Quota domain account (QDA)."
What different quota types are supported by OneFS?,"SmartQuotas consists of two types of capacity quota, accounting quotas and enforcement quotas."
What's the difference between accounting quotas and enforcement quotas?,"Accounting Quotas simply monitor and report on the amount of storage consumed, but do not take any limiting action or intervention. Instead, they are primarily used for auditing, planning, or billing purposes. Enforcement Quotas on the other hand include all of the functionality of the accounting option plus the ability to limit disk storage and send notifications. Using enforcement limits, you can logically partition a cluster to control or restrict how much storage that a user, group, or directory can use."
What does a QuotaScan job do?,"The QuotaScan job is the cluster maintenance process responsible for scanning the cluster to performing accounting activities to bring the determined governance to each inode. In essence, the job is a distributed tree walk that is performed based on the state of the domain."
What information does a quota report include?,"Each generated quota report includes the quota domain definition, state, usage, and global configuration settings. "
What's PermissionRepair job?,"The OneFS PermissionRepair job, as the name suggests, provides an automated way to fix access controls across a dataset. This can be invaluable for a number of scenarios including access controls breaking as a result of inheritable permissions being set incorrectly, user changes and identity management changes, etc."
What modes does a PermissionRepair job support?,"The PermissionRepair job contains three different execution options, or modes, depending on the resolution required: clone, convert and inherit."
Why to use PermissionRepair job instead of the UNIX ‘chmod’ command?,"Permission Repair is considerably more efficient than the ""chmod"" command, because it performs its operations in parallel across all nodes in the cluster (albeit using the same system calls that chmod uses). As such, Permission Repair is a much faster way to effect large scale permissions changes across a sizable directory tree."
How does OneFS cluster guarantee the consistency?,"OneFS does not compromise on Consistency, and uses a simple quorum to prevent partitioning, or ‘split-brain’ conditions that can be introduced if the cluster should temporarily divide into two clusters. The quorum rule guarantees that, regardless of how many nodes fail or come back online, if a write takes place, it can be made consistent with any previous writes that have ever taken place. "
How is Isilon 6th generation platform constructed?,"The Isilon 6th generation platform is composed of four nodes in a single 4U chassis. Within the chassis, each node is completely independent, consisting of five drive sleds, a compute bundle, and cache SSDs, depending on the node. Each drive sled contains up to six drives. The new platform offers six node types in three distinct categories, All-Flash, Hybrid, and Archive."
How to expand the OneFS cluster on a NetApp system?,"Expanding storage on a NetApp system requires adding disk shelves in 7-mode and adding controllers in Clustered Mode. After which, the storage structure must be configured including volume creation and partitioning disks."
How does a single-protocol environment handle user access and file permissions?,"In legacy single protocol environments, a clear separation of protocol and authentication existed. Microsoft users authenticated with Active Directory, while Linux users authenticated with LDAP. Microsoft users accessed files through CIFS or SMB and Linux users through NFS. In a single-protocol environment, cross-platform access was not an option as Microsoft users would not access files created through NFS and vice-versa."
How does a UNIX Identifier work?,"In a single-protocol environment,the Unix Identifier (UID) identifies a user with a positive integer assigned by a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server. The UID maps to several Group Identifiers (GID) to determine access permissions. At login,the user ID is mapped to the matching UID and GID. "
How does a Microsoft Security Identifier work?,"In a Microsoft environment, the Security Identifier (SID) is a unique value assigned to a user, group, and accounts. The SID is issued by a security authority, which in most cases is the Domain Controller and is pulled from the Active Directory database. At login, an Access Token is generated. "
How does PowerScale OneFS support the multi-protocol environment?,PowerScale OneFS developed the Unified Permission Model to implement multi-protocol support. 
What's the core of OneFS Unified Permission Model?,"At the core of the Unified Permission Model is the OneFS Authentication, Identity Management, and Authorization (AIMA) model. "
What is OneFS AIMA model?,"AIMA stack consists of Authentication, Identity Management and Authorization. AIMA's mission is to ensure the right types of users access the right type of data on Isilon."
What's POSIX file state?,"The POSIX file state is best for environments with heavy read and writes from NFS or HDFS clients. If SMB clients are accessing the file, it is for read-only, and the synthetic ACL is created at access time. In the POSIX file state, the limiting factor is DACLs, as only Owner, Group, and Everyone are available. Therefore, only a maximum of 3 DACLs are supported in the POSIX file state."
What is the first stage in OneFS alert processing?,Event Capture is the first stage in the processing pipeline.
What's the responsibility of Event Capture?,"Event Capture is responsible for reading event occurrences from the kernel queue, storing them safely on persistent local storage, generating attachments and queueing them in priority buckets for analysis."
What is the second stage in OneFS alert processing?,Event Analysis is the second stage in the processing pipeline.
What's the responsibility of Event Analysis?,"Event Analysis process collects related event occurrences together as event group occurrences, which can be processedby the next stage – Reporter."
What is the third stage in OneFS alert processing?,Reporter is the third stage in the processing pipeline.
What's the responsibility of Reporter in OneFS alert system?,"Reporter periodically queries Event Analysis for event group occurrences which have changed. For each of these changes, Reporter evaluates any relevant alert conditions, generating alert requests for any events which are satisfied to the next stage – Alerter."
What's the Alert Condition in OneFS alert system?,Alert Condition defines how event group occurrences are alerted. An alert condition states that a specified set of event groups will be reported on via a specified set of channels under a specified condition.
What is the last stage in OneFS alert processing?,Alerter is the final stage in the processing pipeline. 
What's the responsibility of Alerter in OneFS alert system?,Alerter is responsible for actually delivering the alerts requested by the reporter.
What is Channel in OneFS alert system?,"Channel is a named destination for alerts. A channel specifies the mechanism by which alerts are sent, including SMTP, SNMPTRAP and ConnectEMC."
How to configure the master node in alert?,"The Master node in alert configuration is the node elected as the one to send all the notifications through the channel. This is decided by a lock based election mechanism. The node that obtains the lock first is the master. During initial configuration, it is typically the first node to join the cluster. Restarting CELOG will randomize the allocation."
What is Kerberos authentication?,Kerberos is a ticket-based authentication protocolto prove identities in a very secure manner instead of transferring password over network.
How does OneFS provide support for Kerberos?,OneFS supports Microsoft Kerberos through Microsoft Active Directory authentication provider and MIT Kerberos authentication providers on a OneFS cluster.
What is service principal name?,A service principal name (SPN) represents a service within a cluster and it has a specific secret key stored in the Kerberos server.
What security types does OneFS support?,"There are four authentication methods (also known as security types) supported by OneFS: UNIX, Kerberos5, Kerberos5 Integrity, and Kerberos5 Privacy."
